Use mic to record the voice input and store it as .wav file.
Process the signal using correlation method to verify the voice.
Depending on limitations of other models, the technique called cross correlation for
recognition of speech is used and simulated in MATLAB.
Correlation compares the two signals, considering the samples and comparing them
with the test sample gives us the result.
